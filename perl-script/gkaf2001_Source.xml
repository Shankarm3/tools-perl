The association of Ku70/80 with DSB ends facilitates the assembly of the DNA-PK holoenzyme. However, key mechanisms underlying the attachment and stabilization of DNA-PK at broken DNA ends remain unclear. Here, we identify PRRX1, a homeodomain-containing protein, as a mediator of chromatin localization and subsequent activation of DNA-PK. PRRX1 oligomerizes to simultaneously bind to double-strand DNA and the SAP domain of Ku70, thereby enhancing Ku anchoring at DSBs and stabilizing DNA-PK for efficient NHEJ repair. Reduced expression or pathogenic mutations of PRRX1 are associated with genomic instability and impaired NHEJ repair. Furthermore, a peptide that disrupts PRRX1 oligomerization compromises NHEJ efficiency and reduces cell survival following irradiation. These findings provide new insights into the activation of the NHEJ machinery and offer potential strategies for optimizing cancer therapies<query><button type="button" title="AU: The abstract has been edited as a single paragraph to match journal style.

These findings underscore the complexicity of Ku dynamics. However, critical question remain regarding how the attachment and stabilization of Ku-DNA-PKcs complex are precisely regulated on the chromatin context. Unraveling these mechanisms is essential for a comprehensive understanding of how sensor proteins respond to DSBs and initiate NHEJ.</p><p t="i" title="Paragraph Indented">PRRX1, a member of the PRD class of homeodomain (HD) protein family, plays numerous roles in regulating skeletal cartilage development, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), fibrosis, and other mesoblast lineage-related biological processes [<bibcit rid="bib30 bib31 bib32" title="bibcit" href="#" contenteditable="false" id="link_d3e47257" sno="30 31 32">30â32</bibcit>, <bibcit rid="bib33" title="bibcit" href="#" contenteditable="false" id="link_d3e47558" sno="33">33</bibcit>]. Its primary function is mediated through DNA-binding activity, either as a transcription factor or co-activator. A recent study has showed that PRRX1, in conjunction with FOXM1, promotes the expression of HR-associated genes in prostate cells [<bibcit rid="bib34" title="bibcit" href="#" contenteditable="false" id="link_d3e47859" sno="34">34</bibcit>]. In this study, we unexpectedly revealed a transcription-independent role of PRRX1 in promoting NHEJ. We found that oligomerized PRRX1 directly associates with both Ku and dsDNA to facilitate the assembly and activation of DNA-PK at DSBs. Moreover, pathogenic mutations and low expression of PRRX1 in stomach adenocarcinomas are linked to genomic instability and defective NHEJ. Notably, we demonstrated that the peptide disrupting PRRX1 oligomerization impairs NHEJ efficiency and reduces cell survival following irradiation. This study not only provides novel insight into the role of HD protein in regulating NHEJ, but also holds implications for the development of cancer treatment strategies.</p></sect1><sect1 id="sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><ti title="Heading 1">Materials and methods</ti><sect2 id="sec2-1"><ti title="Heading 2">Animals and genotyping</ti><p t="fl" title="Paragraph No Indent">All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Ethical Committee of Medical Research Institute at Wuhan University. <i>Prrx1</i><sup>+/â</sup> C57BL/6JGpt mice (Strain NO.T013725; <url title="URL" type="uri" href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:">RRID:</url> IMSR_GPT:T013725) were generated by the GemPharmatech (Nanjing, China) using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of PRRX1âs functions, we sought to identify its associated proteins. We performed affinity purification of PRRX1 using GICs stably expressing Flag epitope-tagged PRRX1 isoforms - PRRX1A or PRRX1B - and carried out mass spectrometry (AP-MS) analysis. Unexpectedly, we found that several NHEJ factors, including Ku70 (encoded by <i>XRCC6</i>), Ku80 (encoded by <i>XRCC5</i>), and DNA-PKcs (encoded by <i>PRKDC</i>), are among the top hits (Fig. <figcit rid="fig1" title="figcit" href="#" contenteditable="false" id="link_d3e95974" sno="1">1</figcit>A; <url title="URL" type="uri" href="https://academic.oup.com/mmy/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/mmy/gkaf2001#supplementary-data">Supplementary Table S1</url>).

A serials of MBP-fused PRRX1 truncations and mutations were generated, including the C-terminus-deleted PRRX1A (ÎC), the N-terminal region (N), the HD, and a mutant with conserved residues Asn144/Arg145/Arg146 altered (NRR<sup>Mut</sup>), (Fig. <figcit rid="fig1" title="figcit" href="#" contenteditable="false" id="link_d3e105878" sno="1">1</figcit>F). Pull-down assays revealed that the Ku70-binding capacity of PRRX1 depends on its HD and N-terminal region. Specifically, only the full-length and the C-terminus-deleted (ÎC) PRRX1A could bind to Ku70, while the NRR<sup>Mut</sup> mutant failed to do so (Fig. <figcit rid="fig1" title="figcit" href="#" contenteditable="false" id="link_d3e106479" sno="1">1</figcit>G). Thus, the conserved NRR motif within the HD domain of PRRX1 is crucial to mediate its interaction with Ku70. Interestingly, the ÎC exhibited a higher affinity to GST-Ku70 than the full-length PRRX1, implying that the C-terminal region might limit its ability to bind Ku70. Moreover, the docking between PRRX1 and Ku70/80 showed that Asn144/Arg146 constitutes the interaction interface with the SAP domain of Ku70 (<url title="URL" type="uri" href="https://academic.oup.com/mmy/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/mmy/gkaf2001#supplementary-data">Supplementary Fig. S3</url>D).

We conducted live cell imaging on U2OS cells expressing EGFP-PRRX1A/B to delineate the dynamics of PRRX1 recruitment to DNA damage sites.

We next studied the impact of various DSB factors, including PARP1, 53BP1, Ku70, DNA-PKcs, ATM and the MRN complex [<bibcit rid="bib48 bib49 bib50" title="bibcit" href="#" contenteditable="false" id="link_d3e110482" sno="48 49 50">48â50</bibcit>, <bibcit rid="bib51" title="bibcit" href="#" contenteditable="false" id="link_d3e110783" sno="51">51</bibcit>], on PRRX1 accumulation at DNA damage sites.

It is worth noting that the shorter isoform, PRRX1A, demonstrated stronger DNA-binding affinity compared to the longer isoform, PRRX1B. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and the microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay demonstrated the MBP-PRRX1A or His-PRRX1A binds to both blunt-ended dsDNA and 5â² overhang dsDNA with various overhang lengths (<url title="URL" type="uri" href="https://academic.oup.com/mmy/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/mmy/gkaf2001#supplementary-data">Supplementary Fig. S5</url>A, B). Importantly, only the full-length PRRX1A (MBP-PA) was captured by dsDNA. The NRR motif of PRRX1A, which is essential to mediate the interaction with Ku70, is also required for PRRX1âs binding to DNA, as the NRR<sup>Mut</sup> mutation completely abolished this capacity (Fig. <figcit rid="fig2" title="figcit" href="#" contenteditable="false" id="link_d3e117886" sno="2">2</figcit>F).

In current study, we unveiled a novel role for PRRX1, conventionally recognized as a HD transcription factor, in promoting the accumulation of Ku70/80-DNA-PKcs on DSBs. PRRX1 oligomerizes to enable its simultaneous interactions with both dsDNA and the SAP domain of Ku70, thereby enhancing Ku anchoring at DSBs to stabilize DNA-PK for efficient NHEJ repair (Graphical Abstract).

Mechanistic studies confirmed that HOXB7 binds to Ku70, Ku80, and DNA-PKcs <i>via</i> its HD domain, linking DNA damage resistance to these interactions.

Importantly, depletion of PRRX1 markedly reduced the enrichment of Ku70/80 on the chromatin and compromised NHEJ, whereas the opposite effect was observed upon PRRX1 overexpression. In particular, PRRX1, despite being relatively small, simultaneously interacts with the SAP domain of Ku70 and dsDNA through its NRR motif within the homeodomain. PRRX1 achieves this by forming oligomers <i>via</i> its N-terminal helix Î±1 (107â115 aa) in the HD domain. Of note, the motif essential for PRRX1 oligomerization is unique to PRRX1 and not found in other HD proteins, making it a potential target for improving cancer treatment. Indeed, the competing peptide that disrupts PRRX1 oligomerization blocked NHEJ and hampered the survival of irradiated STAD cells. In addition, we also revealed that PRRX1-specific sequences at both N-terminal and C-termnial parts are involved in its association with Ku70 and dsDNA, as well as oligomerization.</p></sect2><sect2 id="sec4-2"><ti title="Heading 2">PRRX1 senses and accumulates at DNA damage sites</ti><p t="fl" title="Paragraph No Indent">LMI studies revealed that both endogenous and exogenous PRRX1 rapidly accumulate at DNA damage sites. Intriguingly, this accumulation occurs irrespective of known DNA damage sensors, including PARP1, Ku, and the MRN complex, as well as upstream kinases such as ATM and DNA-PKcs. Instead, PRRX1 directly binds to various forms of dsDNA with random sequences but not ssDNA <i>in vitro</i>. Moreover, PRRX1 was found to be associated with chromatin along with Ku70/80 in untreated, irradiated, and ETP treated cells. Further investigations are needed to determine whether PRRX1 exhibits a preference for specific regions or sequences in terms of chromatin and DSB association.</p><p t="i" title="Paragraph Indented">The two isoforms of PRRX1 have different C-terminal ends, which are seemingly not required for its oligomerization or DNA or Ku70 binding. Moreover, both exogenous PRRX1A and PRRX1B exhibited the same kinetics in the recruitment to DSBs. However, we have revealed a few discrepancies of the two isoforms. First, DNA pull-down assays demonstrated that the shorter PRRX1A had a stronger affinity for dsDNA. We speculate that potential co-factors or post-translational modifications of PRRX1 in the cellular context might compensate for the difference in their dsDNA affinity. Second, the sucrose gradient separation assay indicated that the two isoforms were enriched in adjacent and overlapping compartments. Third, the oligomerization efficiency of PRRX1A is higher than PRRX1B. Fourth, the NHEJ efficiency in cells overexpressing PRRX1A was around 10% higher than those overexpressing PRRX1B. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the two isoforms are differentially utilized in specific cellular or stress contexts.
